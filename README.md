#Google's Room with a View with kotlin enhancements

This repo uses Google's Room with a View sample project that demostrates the Android architectural components Room, LiveData, ViewModel in use.  I've also converted the project to kotlin and added kotlin co-routines and Koin.

##Uses:

[Koin] (https://insert-koin.io/) a dependency injection framework
[Kotlin coroutines] (https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) a replacement for RxJava
[AndroidX or Android JetPack] (https://developer.android.com/jetpack/) the latest support libraries for android

##Original project:

[Android Room With a View] (https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-room-with-a-view) original project in github
