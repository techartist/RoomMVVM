Google's Room with a View with kotlin enhancements
==================================================

This repo uses Google's Room with a View sample project that demostrates the Android architectural components Room, LiveData, ViewModel in use.  I've also converted the project to kotlin and added kotlin co-routines and Koin.

Uses:
-----

* [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) a dependency injection framework
* [Kotlin coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) a replacement for RxJava
* [AndroidX or Android JetPack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/) the latest support libraries for android
